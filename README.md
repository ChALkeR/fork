  These are what this application is directly based upon -- four axis
  (touch, openness, speak, critics), used mainly in local Less Wrong meetups,
  but also in generic activity of the anticafe, e.g. lections, coworking, etc.

  This specific format was designed by [@berekuk](https://github.com/berekuk)
  aka the owner of that anti-café.
  A review is available

  Russian).

* Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN)
  [Color Communication Badges](https://autisticadvocacy.org/2014/02/color-communication-badges/).

  One-axis system, specifies only the "Speak" part, i.e. if the person is
  willing to interact to anyone. More details are available in the
  [pdf](https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ColorCommunicationBadges.pdf).
  To my knowledge, this is the oldest of all systems mentioned here and also
  what inspired the Kocherga.club badges above (and many others).

* AlterConf
  [color communication badges](https://alterconf.com/news/introducing-color-communication-badges)
  which they use on conferences since 2017 are directly adopted from ASAN badges
  and feature a one-axis "Speak" system. Also pronouns!
